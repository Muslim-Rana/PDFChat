## Overview

This project uses generative artificial intelligence to create a model which learns from your own custom PDF files which you can upload. The model will use LLM API Keys in order to learn and then answer questions about your documents. Your questions require no specific syntax or formatting, ask whatever type of question in any type of format, using the power of GenAI this model will be able to respond. This project is a personal ChatGPT for your PDFs!!!!
